This was a course project to process 15 minute long videos and create a shorter summary video made up of distinct "shots" or "scenes" from the original.

Our script to generate the summary videos is summary_v2.py. It does shot boundary detection and
also calculates the metrics needed to pick the summary shots.

To play the videos, use oldvideoplayer.py.

Specify test_video or test_video_2 in these files.
